I have to admit, I've been looking forward to this post since before I even had
a blog. I'm a configuration nerd, and  screwing around with my environment and my toolsis one of my favorite parts of writing code. There's just something about getting everything adjusted _just_ right that gives me a little high REST OF INTRO

As much fun as the tweaking itself is, there's a specific goal that I'm going
for when I'm setting up my environment. Basically, my goal is to remove as much
friction from the process of writing code as I possibly can. The reason is
simple - I _suck_ at focus. 

How you get code
from your brain onto the screen is a huge part of this, but writing code entails
more than just getting text into the editor. Think of all the other things
you're managing while you write code: version control, building the code,
testing the code, running a server, or maybe an emulator, running a web browser
- you get the idea. That's a lot to manage, and when you haven't invested time
  in making things easy for yourself, switching contexts between all these
things can put a heavy load on your brain.
