holy shit, this takes almost no code
simple af

just dies if a command fails - need to catch the exception, i'd guess 

does it have a more sophisticated way to pass in hosts? e.g. not having to read the file

my ips aren't static and not everything is in my hosts file
although the ones that are could just use their hostname

i need to install my config

what i used it for: 
example - print hostname
copy ssh id eveywhere (which I;d been wanting for a while)
ruby gem problem (reason i started)

could think of way to run command everywhere easily
